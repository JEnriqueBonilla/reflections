1) How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
by marking easily the differences with the signs plus and minus
easier to check
2) How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
if you want to do something from some point you changed, with version control its easy to do so.
3) What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros: logical form
cons: you can forget to make a commit after some time
4) Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
so its easier to save everthing and quicker, in google docs saving everything at the same time could cause mistakes
5) How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log -stats displays you the statistics and changes on all files
6) How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
it is easir to track down where you commited the mistake
7) Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
to try it on my code
